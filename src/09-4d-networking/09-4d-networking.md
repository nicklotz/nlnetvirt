# 4D Networking
- Forward-thinking approach to address the complexity and manageability challenges in network design and operation
- Model aims to simplify network management by breaking it down into four distinct but interrelated dimensions
  - Decision
  - Dissemination
  - Discovery
  - Data

## Understanding the four: "D"s
### Decision plane
- Where network-wide control logic resides
- Unlike traditional networks where decisions are made by individual devices, in a 4-D network, decisions about policies, traffic routing, security, and other network behaviors are centralized.
- More coherent and optimized decision-making processes that can adapt to the overall network state and objectives
- Decision Plane analyzes the network's current state and makes strategic decisions to guide the network towards desired outcomes
### Dissemination Plane
- Responsible for implementing the decisions made by the Decision Plane across the network
- Necessary information, configurations, and policies are applied to the network devices (such as switches and routers)
- Handles the distribution of control messages and updates
- Ensures that every part of the network is configured according to the central logic's directives
### Discovery Plane
- Tasked with understanding the network's structure and state
- Continuously collects data about the network's topology, performance metrics, faults, and configurations
- Provides a real-time view of the network to the Decision Plane, enabling informed decision-making
- Uses mechanisms such as network scanning and monitoring
- Ensures network's current state is accurately known and that changes in the network are quickly detected and reported
### Data Plane
- Responsible for forwarding traffic based on the rules and configurations provided by the Dissemination Plane
- Handles the actual movement of packets across the network
- Ensures that data reaches its intended destinations efficiently and reliably
- Operates at the network devices level, executing the forwarding decisions made by the higher-level planes
