# Routing Control Platform
- Advanced concept in the management and operation of networks
- Aim to centralize and abstract the control logic of routing decisions away from individual network devices

## Key Features of Routing Control Platforms
### Centralized Control
- By centralizing routing decisions, RCPs can optimize network paths, manage congestion, and respond dynamically to changing network conditions or failures
### Abstraction
- RCPs abstract the underlying complexity of network hardware and protocols, presenting a simplified interface to network operators
- Facilitates easier network configuration, management, and troubleshooting
### Programmability
- RCPs offer programmable interfaces
- Enables network operators to implement custom routing policies and adapt network behavior to meet specific requirements or objectives
### Multi-Protocol Support
- RCPs often support multiple routing protocols, integrating with existing network infrastructures
- Enables a gradual transition to SDN paradigms without requiring a complete overhaul of network hardware

## Applications of Routing Control Platforms
### Traffic engineering
- RCPs can be used to implement sophisticated traffic engineering policies
- Optimizes the flow of traffic across the network to improve bandwidth utilization and reduce latency
### Fault management
- By centrally managing routing decisions, RCPs can quickly detect and respond to network failures
- Reroutes traffic as needed to maintain service continuity
### Security
- Centralized control also allows for the implementation of advanced security policies
- Enables more effective monitoring, threat detection, and response mechanisms

## Introduction to ONIX Controllers
- Distributed control platform designed to address the scalability and reliability challenges of managing large-scale networks in cloud computing environments
- Provides a framework for building distributed control applications
- Offers both the flexibility of distributed systems and the centralized overview of network state and topology that is characteristic of SDN
### Key Aspects of ONIX
#### Distributed control
- Unlike traditional SDN controllers that may operate from a single or a few centralized points, ONIX employs a distributed architecture
- Enhances the scalability and fault tolerance of the control plane
- Well-suited for large-scale and geographically dispersed networks
#### Network Information Base (NIB)
- ONIX uses a distributed data store known as the Network Information Base (NIB)
- Maintain a consistent view of the network's state across all instances of the controller
- NIB enables applications to read from and write to a shared view of the network
- Facilitates complex, distributed network management tasks
#### Programmability
- ONIX provides APIs that allow developers to create sophisticated network control applications
- These applications can implement
  - Custom routing protocols
  - Network virtualization
  - Other advanced network functions
### Applications of ONIX
#### Large Data Center Networks
- ONIX is particularly well-suited for managing the complex and dynamic networks of large data centers
  - Including cloud computing services
- Distributed nature allows it to scale across thousands of switches and hosts
#### Network Virtualization
- ONIX can be used to implement network virtualization layers
- Enables multiple virtual networks to coexist on a single physical infrastructure with customized topologies, addressing schemes, and security policies
#### Dynamic Traffic Management
- The programmability and real-time network state information provided by ONIX enable the implementation of dynamic traffic management solutions
- Optimizes network performance based on current conditions and application requirements
